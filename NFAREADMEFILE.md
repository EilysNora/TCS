# NFA Simulator with λ-Transitions

A C++ implementation of a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) simulator that handles epsilon (λ) transitions and computes extended transition functions (δ*).

## Features

- **Complete NFA Simulation**: Handles both regular and epsilon transitions
- **λ-Closure Computation**: Calculates epsilon closures for states and state sets
- **Extended Transition Function**: Computes δ*(q, a) and δ*(T, a) as defined in formal language theory
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly menu system for easy testing
- **Robust Error Handling**: Validates all inputs and prevents crashes
- **State Transition Tracing**: Shows complete path computations
